"""
Given a BEFORE.PY and AFTER.PY, extracts all matching pairs of functions and
class methods.

Explanation of the process:

1. Scan BEFORE.PY, recording all functions and methods.
2. Scan AFTER.PY, recording all functions and methods.
3. Attempt to pair off all functions in BEFORE.PY with all functions in AFTER.PY
   by name.

We make some big assumptions to make things easy:

1. Classes and functions are never created, removed, moved, or renamed.

- If a function is missing from BEFORE.PY but in AFTER.PY (or vice versa), we
  don't care about it.
- If a function is renamed in AFTER.PY, we don't care about it.

2. Functions are always at the top (module) level, or inside a class.

- We don't care about functions defined inside other functions.
- We don't care about lambdas.

3. Classes are always at the top (module) level.

- We don't care about classes inside other classes, or classes inside functions.

4. Within a single module, functions, methods, and classes have unique names.

- Each function is uniquely identified by its name
    - key: <function name>
- Each method is uniquely identified by <Class name> + <method name>
    - key: <class name>.<function name>
    - We don't distinguish between class methods, static methods, and instance
      methods
    - We don't care about getters and setters

...ugh. Can we just diff entire files instead?
